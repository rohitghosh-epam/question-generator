## Assessment Tool for Problem Solving Skills for Data Structures and Algorithms

# Objective

## Develop an app or tool that simulates an assessment platform by generating problems of varying complexity (Easy, Medium, Hard) to evaluate a developerâ€™s DS-ALGO skills

# Requirements

1. The app/tool should accept the problem's complex( Easy | Medium | Hard) level to be assessed by the Developer. 
2. It should provide problems based on the Data Structures(Arrays, List...) or Algorithms (DP, Recursion, Backtracking, Sorting, Searching, Greedy...) the developer wants to assess. 
3. The tool should be able to assess the complexity of the solution after the developer submits the solution. 
4. The tools should also give grades 1-5 based on the clean code, best complexity, and testability. 
5. Provide a simple user interface for interacting with the assessment tool.
